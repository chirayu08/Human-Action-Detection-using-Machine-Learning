# Human Activity Recognition using Mobile Health Sensor Data

## 📌 Overview
This project uses **Mobile Health (mHealth) sensor data** to classify **human activities** such as walking, running, sitting, climbing stairs, cycling, etc., using machine learning algorithms.

The dataset contains accelerometer and gyroscope readings from multiple body locations, along with activity labels.  
Our model learns from these signals to predict the performed activity.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mhealth-activity-recognition.git
cd mhealth-activity-recognition
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Dataset

Download the dataset from Kaggle:

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d gaurav2022/mobile-health
unzip mobile-health.zip
```

Ensure the CSV file (`mhealth_raw_data.csv`) is in the project directory.

### What the Code Does:

1. **Load Dataset** from CSV.
2. **Data Exploration** – Check missing values, duplicates, activity counts.
3. **Balancing Data** – Sample "None" class to avoid imbalance.
4. **Activity Visualization** – Plot line charts & histograms for each activity.
5. **Data Cleaning** – Remove outliers using the 1st & 99th percentile range.
6. **Feature Scaling** – Robust Scaler to normalize sensor readings.
7. **Model Training** – Multiple ML algorithms tested:
   * Logistic Regression
   * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   * Decision Tree
   * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   * Naive Bayes
   * Random Forest (and can be extended to XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
8. **Evaluation** – Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
